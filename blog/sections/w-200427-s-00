Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first blog post and I'm really excited to be documenting my journey of exploring lots of 
tech. 

My exams ended on April 22, and since then I've been thinking about what cool projects I'll want to work on over the summer. I only 
have a week off before I start my remote internship at Amazon on May 4.

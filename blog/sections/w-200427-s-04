I got my DE10-Nano board!!!! I'm so excited!!

When I opened the box, the first things I see are a few guides:

And finally... the actual board!!! It's so pretty and it can fit on my hand! Very cool!

Aaand to add to my collection of hobby electronics.. I have a little corner in the living room where I keep all my 
boxes of electronics since I'm working with them a lot recently.

ALRIGHT so now we dig in. The Nano board package comes with a handy-dandy Quick Start Guide detailing step by step instructions 
on how to get started with the board. By the end of following these instructions, we'll see an HTML web page generated by the Nano on our PC, 
called start.html. 

Something to note is that the MicroSD card comes already installed on the board in the MicroSD socket, and the card has a linux OS installed. 
So, to start off with you don't even need to worry about creating an image for the HPS! You just follow the quick start instructions and
go from there.

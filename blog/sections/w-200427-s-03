### Personal Website

The other thing I did this week is revamp my personal website. Before the revamp, my personal website was a single page simple website
with just my name written animated as if it was being written in a terminal, and some links for my contact information.

I wanted to start
documenting the stuff I do on the side (the tech projects), so I decided to write a "blog post" every week where I document what I did
that week and what I learned. Right now the main reason I'm doing this is so I can keep everything I am learning/doing in one place, so I can
remember little things in the future. I know once I get my DE10-Nano board I'll be learning a lot of new things and I want to keep all my notes
somewhere accessible by me and by others who are also interested in getting into hobby FPGA development. 

I revamped my website using a template I found from w3schools. It was a basic 1 page parallex template - just what I needed. I used my sister's
original artwork as the backgrounds because I think they're really pretty! In the end my revamp of the website turned out to look really artsy..
perhaps a bit too artsy for someone in software engineering? Usually when I see other developer's personal websites, they're all super cool
with fancy CSS/JS and the themes are all very tech-y and they all look very good. I really like how my website turned out, even if it looks
too artsy. Because this website is *my* personal space. There are no rules here; I can express myself the way I want to. For someone seeking a more 
professional portfolio, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areeba-aziz/) or [resume](../../pdf/Resume_11.pdf)! But I hope to use this website to just be me. And to share my experiences of exploring cool tech projects!

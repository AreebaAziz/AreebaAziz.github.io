 

### First FPGA Design

I'm going to follow the instructions on the ["My First FPGA" guide](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive_download.pl?Language=English&No=1046&FID=86a1c2f74b7ff8a8abf58d2b4689d4be) from Terasic.

First I downloaded Quartus II Prime Standard Edition from [Intel's website](https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/). The download took a long time, I let it run for a few hours while I was doing other stuff. Once it was downloaded as a .tar file, I unzipped by running:

```
	mkdir Quartus-19.1.0.670
	tar -xvf Quartus-19.1.0.670-linux-complete.tar -C Quartus-19.1.0.670
```

Next, I cd'd into the Quartus-19.1.0.670 directory and found a ``setup.sh`` file. I ran by ``sh setup.sh``. This opened up a GUI 
installer. I checked off the following components to install:

After it was installed, it prompted me to enter licensing information, or buy a license or start a limited 30-day trial. 
My university provides license for Quartus, so I used that and now I'm in Quartus!!

Now following the "My First FPGA" guide, I'm going to take some important notes:

- A Quartus II project consists of a set of files that maintain information about our FPGA design.
	- The Settings file (.qsf) and Project file (.qpf) are the primary files in a project
- First, we create a new project. Go to File -> New Project Wizard. 
- There must be a top-level design entity of each project. Sort of like a "main" function in traditional programming. 

While creating a new project, we select a device for our board, which for the DE10-Nano is:

In the next step, the New Project Wizard prompts you to specify some EDA tools. I will be using SystemVerilog as the HDL instead of Verilog, as I've read that SystemVerilog is a superset of Verilog, is newer and has more features. I've also used SystemVerilog extensively in one of my digital circuits classes so I'm quite familiar with it.

Once I click Finish, Quartus creates the new project!

Now I'm actually going to diverge from the "My First FPGA" guide. This guide uses a combination of schematic capture and HDL, but I only want to design in HDL. Something important I learned by going through the tutorial was what a "Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)" is. I've seen PLL a lot and learned about it in class but I forgot so I looked it up, and according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop):

> A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related
> to the phase of an input signal. (...) They can be used to (...) distribute precisely timed clock pulses in digital 
> logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop 
> building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction 
> of a hertz up to many gigahertz. 

Very cool! So basically a PLL is used to generate a precise clock signal given an input clock (oscillator) and a multiplier. So on the DE10-Nano, 
there's a 50Hz oscillator (I think), by using a PLL you can use that input clock signal and generate any frequency output clock signal to use for your
design. I think I'm going to need a PLL in pretty much all my designs, except maybe purely combinational designs that don't require a clock.
